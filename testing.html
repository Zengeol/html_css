                    There was an old man of Peru
                    Who dreamt he was eating his shoe
                    He woke up in the night
                    With a terrible fright
                    And found it was perfectly true

                What is this
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <!--This is how I write comments-->
                        <div style="color: red; background-color:aqua;">
                            Hello I use CSS to make it red with aqua background. CSS is a property. seperated by ";".<br>
                            Here are other ways we can style though. e.g. by using style tag.</div>
                            <div>
                                <style>p { color: red; }</style>
                                <p>
                                    "p" is telling the system that all the "p" paragraph in p, make it red.
